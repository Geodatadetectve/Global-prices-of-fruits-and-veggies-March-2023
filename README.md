SKILLS
Web scraping, Data Mining, Data cleaning, Data merging, Desktop design, Data visualization, and Data insights

PROCESS
✅ Six tables were presented for each of Apples, Banana, Beans, Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
✅ The schema of the file type (CSV), data structure (six tables), # of records (average of 95 per table) and # of fields (3) including countries, prices and the rank.
✅Then, I reviewed the data to find any bad data points, missing data, and duplicated data to perform accurate analysis, visualize the data, and draw actionable insights.  
✅Not all the countries have data available for some of the fruits and vegetables. Hence, some null values found.
✅Then, I cleaned and transformed the data. First by changing the format of all the prices and ranks to numeric and changing the countries to location (text).
✅Data manipulation, merging and transformation. All the tables were merged into a single table based on the ‘Countries’ field using the VLOOKUP function in Excel.
✅ Then the cleaned and final table was loaded into Tableau.
✅ Final step was to dive into the cleaned data and obtain important actionable insights on the prices of Apples per country, the most expensive and cheapest apples, and by comparing the prices of apples with those other countries.
